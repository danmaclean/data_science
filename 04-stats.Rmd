# Understanding Statistics With Linear Models

In this topic we will take a look at common statistical methods. Rather than launch into a long list of tests and conditions for use that seems arbitrary we will take advantage of the fact that they are all special cases of a simple tool called a linear model. We will learn about linear models and how to use them to carry out statistical inference. By the end of this topic you will have a clear understanding of how and why to use a linear model in R to carry out most test.
