In here you will find links to the written content for each of the separate topics covered as well as the descriptions of the course assessments and projects. 

## Course Delivery

Data Science is a set of practical research skills grounded in statistics and computer science. Learning a practical skill requires practice! So this course is not a lecture course, it is a 'flipped' classroom course with a very strong practical component. In a flipped classroom the onus is on the student to lead their work and practice with the provided materials prior to contact and discussion time with the wider learning group and group mentors. To get the most out of this course you must read the relevant online material before you come to the contact sessions. Contact time will then be an opportunity to discuss the materials and any problems arising with the group and the teacher and to practice and problem solve with others. The aim is that by the end of the course you will have a strong practical grounding in applying data science approaches to research problems that will enhance the biology that you are doing.  

## Online Materials

The rest of this handbook outlines the online materials provided to you for this course, broken down by the separate topics we will cover. The materials are a mixture of self-led tutorials and interactive challenges or problems to solve.    

## Installation of software and tools

If you are using a TSL laptop specifically given to you for the MSc then all the software and tools you will need should already be installed on that machine. Each topic presents installation instructions for those not accessing the materials as part of the MSc or for installation on other or personal machines should they be needed. 

## Course Topics

We will cover the following topics in data science

    1. Introduction to Genomics
    2. Data Exploration and Visualisation
    3. Understanding Statistics With Linear Models
    4. Introduction to Non-Frequentist Statistics
    5. Introduction to Machine Learning
    6. Beginning Programming
    7. Literate Computation


Sections 1,2,3 and 7 are considered the core parts and each has guided study parts that we will use. Sections 4,5 and 6 are considered extension parts. The core will be covered first and the extension parts can be covered as we decide in the class dependent on preference and interest. 

## Course Assessments

The culmination of all this learning and practice will be a written essay and a data analysis project on which you will be assessed and receive a grade. These will be set during the course and deadlines will be given to you explicitly for each. You will not be formally assessed on other projects, quizzes and challenges occurring through the course.
