# Data Exploration and Visualisation

Data exploration and visualisation is the first step in most analyses and the R statistical computing environment is a great tool to work with. 

In this topic we will explore techniques in R that allow us answer research questions of our data in a way that follows consistent and straightforward principles. We will learn a data format for keeping our research data organised so that we can readily apply all sorts of useful tools to it. We will also learn a grammar of plots that will allow us to make informative and clear figures. By the end of this you will be comfortable with using R to summarise and work with data frames and create a wide range of plots.
