Wrapping commands in scripts is a great way to re-do an analysis without having to type everything in again. But scripts are for computers to read, not humans, so understanding and interpreting an analysis rendered as code alone is not good for general understanding. In this course weâ€™ll look at tools and techniques for Literate Computation, a mixing of code, results and human language that results in easily understood executable and re-useable analysis documents. We will also look at tools and strategies for sharing and getting credit for your code and analysis. At the end of this topic you will have a good understanding of how to construct reproducible, reusable and readable analysis documents and how to share them online.
