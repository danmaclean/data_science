Figure 1.1: Artwork by AllisonHorst In here you will find links to the written content for each of the separate topics covered as well as the descriptions of the course assessments and projects. 1.1 Course Delivery Data Science is a set of practical research skills grounded in statistics and computer science. Learning a practical skill requires practice! So this course is not a lecture course, it is a ‘flipped’ classroom course with a very strong practical component. In a flipped classroom the onus is on the student to lead their work and practice with the provided materials prior to contact and discussion time with the wider learning group and group mentors. To get the most out of this course you must read the relevant online material before you come to the contact sessions. Contact time will then be an opportunity to discuss the materials and any problems arising with the group and the teacher and to practice and problem solve with others. The aim is that by the end of the course you will have a strong practical grounding in applying data science approaches to research problems that will enhance the biology that you are doing. 1.2 Online materials The rest of this handbook outlines the online materials provided to you for this course, broken down by the separate topics we will cover. The materials are a mixture of self-led tutorials and interactive challenges or problems to solve. 1.3 Course Topics We will cover the following topics in data science 1. Introduction to Genomics 2. Data Exploration and Visualisation 3. Understanding Statistics With Linear Models 4. Introduction to Non-Frequentist Statistics 5. Introduction to Machine Learning 6. Beginning Programming 7. Literate Computation 1.4 Course Assessments The culmination of all this learning and practice will be a written essay and a large group project on which you will be assessed and receive a grade. These will be set at the end of the course and deadlines will be given to you explicitly for each. You will not be formally assessed on other projects, quizzes and challenges occurring through the course. "]]
