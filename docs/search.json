    "text": "Course Delivery\nData Science is a set of practical research skills grounded in statistics and computer science. Learning a practical skill requires practice! So this course is not a lecture course, it is a ‘flipped’ classroom course with a very strong practical component. In a flipped classroom the onus is on the student to lead their work and practice with the provided materials prior to contact and discussion time with the wider learning group and group mentors. To get the most out of this course you must read the relevant online material before you come to the contact sessions. Contact time will then be an opportunity to discuss the materials and any problems arising with the group and the teacher and to practice and problem solve with others. The aim is that by the end of the course you will have a strong practical grounding in applying data science approaches to research problems that will enhance the biology that you are doing.",

    "text": "All experimental science is data science sooner or later\nAt first thought, you may imagine that data science is not going to be of much interest to you, your desire and interest is in biology, not computers and mathematics. That may be true but data science is actually going to be one of the main technical themes throughout your entire scientific career and it will help you truly master your science and to become an informed and healthily sceptical interpreter of scientific results. Adding data science as your super power will be of benefit in lots of ways. Learning data science now isn’t a tax on your time so that you can get through this M.Sc, it’s a valuable investment in your skill set that will help to give you an advantage that will pay definite dividends later. Getting on with data science is like getting on with Jedi training for biologists\n“Data Science” is a new-ish term that describes an interdisciplinary approach to the practical application of statistics and computer science concepts and tools. The term data scientist is most often applied to people who analyse large amounts of high throughput data full time and have a research or industrial interest in that but the techniques of data science are useful to all researchers, data science is useful to biologists. There is no such thing as a purely lab- or field-based biologist, once our data are collected we must use it in a computer to perform analyses, draw conclusions and draw figures. All modern scientists are at some point a data scientist, irrespective of field and training. Knowledge of data science techniques will therefore underpin everything you do as a scientist at the most fundamental level, from experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of results. A scientist that lacks data science skills will find it very difficult to progress beyond the most basic levels of expertise in experimental analysis.",

    "text": "Bootcamp\nFlipped classroom\nOnline tutorial\n\n\n\nBootcamp\nThe bootcamp style class is an instructor led practical session. You will be expected to follow an instructor who is teaching and live coding from the front of the class. This is not a lecture where you take notes - its a computer class where you work concurrently with the instructor as they exemplify the skills you will need to learn to use. Much more like a cookery class than a university lecture, the session proceeds with the instructor demonstrating how to do a specific computer-based skill and you try it out immediately. It is very, very useful to take the opportunity to read the materials for bootcamps before the session. Learning from this style requires you to be alert and engaged with the material in the session, not least you should put effort into joining in and being part of the group. Be prepared to make mistakes and be at peace with not knowing yet and being on a journey of learning. Sitting back and hoping to catch up with it later in your own time will put you behind and waste the opportunity of the session.\n\n\nFlipped classroom\nThe ‘flipped’ classroom style here is one in which the reading is done by the student before the session. This gives time for reflection and understanding of the concepts such that they can be applied to solve the problem sets that come up in the session. The instructor will not conduct a comprehensive overview of the materials during the session, instead they will concentrate on issues arising in the application of the concepts. If you have not done the reading before the session then you will be behind from the start of the session and you will miss out on the opportunity. Learning from this style is requires you to lead and take responsibility for the learning before class and to work to apply the theoretical knowledge in the practical session.\n\n\nOnline tutorial\nThe most traditional style of session will be the online tutorial in which you will work through an online guide with embedded quizzes and questions on a particular topic. The materials will be provided in the session. Learning from this style of session requires you to be thinking through the questions and reasoning to work out the answers with the materials provided.",

    "text": "JONK\nFor all learning you should embrace JONK - ‘Joy of Not Knowing’ (Staricoff 2020). Although you are at least a Post-Grad there are still a lot of things and skills to learn and you will spend a lot of time confused. This is fine. And expected, and a necessary part of learning - if it was easy you wouldn’t be learning anything. Over and over again you’ll fall into the metaphorical ‘Learning Pit’ (Nottingham 2015) and through working at a problem sincerely with a view to understanding you’ll reach real success - a good understanding of the topics you are learning about.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork from James Nottingham - https://www.challenginglearning.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dark side\nLots of people want to use data science and statistics so lots of other people publish blog posts and tutorials on those topics on the internet. A quick google will lead you to how-to’s in briefer and shallower form than this course. Be wary of taking these as an answer, although they aren’t wrong per se, the useful and particular ways of thinking about data science that this course is aimed at helping you understand are not so often developed in the quick online tutorials. They can help you with an immediate coding problem, it can take a very long time to develop broad and flexible understanding of data science through just looking stuff up on the internet and applying them until they seem to work. This dark side is quick, easy and seductive but won’t bring you a good understanding. Take your time and work through the details and you’ll emerge with a much more adaptable and applicable set of skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ChatGPT and other ’bots\nIt is perfectly acceptable to use ChatGPT and other AI’s to help you to work with code. AI’s like that can’t do ‘thinking’ but they can do ‘parsing’ so if you have a very specific question especially about syntax do feel free to use it. Remember that these sorts of tools are ‘cliche machines’ they generate an average answer, which isn’t going to be helpful when you want to come up with an analysis strategy that is very tailored to an individual research question. It won’t do a good job of telling you which test to use.\n\n\nThe twin learning challenge\nOne difficult thing about learning to solve data questions with code is that you have to learn two things at the same time; how to solve the problem in code (how to program) and how to actually correctly write the code (learn the syntax of your chosen language). Its perfectly possible to get the first thing right and falter with the second, the second being incredibly easy to get wrong. Syntax in computer languages is incredibly picky and requires an eye for detail. One misplaced letter or punctuation mark and the code fails. In order to help with this it can be useful to learn how to use some tools to help with syntax. Here’s a short list.\n\nThe Language Help System\nMost languages have a help system, in R this is accessed in the ‘help’ pane of RStudio or by putting a ? in front of a search term in the console, so ?print will return entries in the help that have print in their title or description. (Note that ?how do I do a t-test won’t return much. It’s a syntax based help, not a ‘how to’).\nChatGPT\nThis is a great tool for checking syntax of general stuff, these bots have a good internal description of the syntax of well discussed topics, so you can double check your code for syntax errors by pasting it into ChatGPT. It might struggle a bit with less used packages and certainly will give you poor advice on how to actually create your analysis.\nStack Overflow\nA website for contributions on solving particular well-defined and specific (e.g ‘how do I extract a column from a table’) coding problems. If you have a problem with code then probably someone else has had the same issue asked about it and hopefully go an answer. Googling a coding problem will likely hit a Stack Overflow entry, so start with Google.",

We will learn to abandon the \\(p\\)-value as a final arbiter of decision making and see that it is not the only statistic that matters. We will look at using Bayesian inference to make comparisons of hypotheses about our data. By the end of this course you will be able to use and interpret standardised effect sizes and create confidence intervals and estimation plots in R. You will be able to use and interpret Bayesian versions of some common statistical tests\nFor this topic we will use these courses",

Code comes in many guises and in this course up to now we’ve been writing code for specific tasks with a clear and present idea of what we want to get done. General programming concepts often seem less useful because of their generality, so in this topic we will study the general concepts that will allow us to program in most problem domains. We will introduce the central concepts of programming and learn to use the implementations of them in the Python general purpose programming language. At the end of this topic you will be aware of the most important concepts in programming and how to use them in Python.\nFor this topic we will use these courses",

Wrapping commands in scripts is a great way to re-do an analysis without having to type everything in again. But scripts are for computers to read, not humans, so understanding and interpreting an analysis rendered as code alone is not good for general understanding. In this course we’ll look at tools and techniques for Literate Computation, a mixing of code, results and human language that results in easily understood executable and re-useable analysis documents. We will also look at tools and strategies for sharing and getting credit for your code and analysis. At the end of this topic you will have a good understanding of how to construct reproducible, reusable and readable analysis documents and how to share them online.\nFor this topic we will use this course:",
